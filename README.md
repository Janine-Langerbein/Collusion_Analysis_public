# A Data Mining Approach for Detecting Collusion in Unproctored Online Exams

## Data 

Due to the General Data Protection Regulation (DPR), the data provided in this repository is not the original data used in the analysis. However, we have provided a toy dataset to illustrate our approach.

## Workflow 

The main file of this analysis is `code.R`. However, the code will only execute correctly if you open the `EDM.Rproj` and then open the code file, which lies in folder `01_code`.

We used the `pacman` package to auto-install all necessary packages. Depending on your security settings, the `pacman` package workflow might not execute, and you have to install the packages manually. The used packages can be found in `01_code/packages.R`.
