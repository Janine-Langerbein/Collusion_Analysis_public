## Data 

The provided data in this repository are not the original data used in the analysis due to GDPR. 

## Workflow 


The main file of this analysis is `code.R`. However, the code will only execute correctly if you open the `EDM.Rproj` and then open the code file, which lies in folder `01_code`.

We used the `pacman` package to auto-install all necessary packages. Sometimes something else is needed, and you must install the packages by hand. The used packages can be found in `01_code/packages.R`.
